Steganography is the practice of hiding information in another message or physical object to avoid detection. The word comes from the Greek words steganos, meaning "hidden or covered," and graph, meaning "to write". 
Here are some types of steganography:
Image steganography
Involves hiding data within an image file. The image used is called the cover image, and the resulting image is called the stego image. 
Audio steganography
Involves hiding data within an audio signal. The host message before and after steganography have the same characteristics. 
Video steganography
Involves hiding data within a video file. The video can function as the "carrier" for the hidden data. 
Network steganography
Involves hiding data within a network protocol, such as TCP, UDP, ICMP, or IP. 
Steganography can be used to hide almost any type of digital content, including text, images, video, or audio. The hidden data can be extracted at its destination. 
Steganography differs from cryptography, which is the art of converting a plaintext (message) into an unreadable format.
